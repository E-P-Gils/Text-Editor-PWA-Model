  ## Description 

In this project I created my first installable Progressive Web App with IndexedDB and caching. 

  ## Installation 

  You can git clone the project to install it if you want to play with it. You can also access it online on heroku.

  ## Usage

  There is a button that allows you to install the app and use it on your  desktop rather than in browser.
